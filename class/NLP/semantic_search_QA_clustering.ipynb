        "\n",
        "The sentence_transformers library provides a utility for community detection which applies a threshold on the cosine similarity score to identify distinct communities of sentences that are semantically similar. This method can be particularly helpful for organizing a large corpus of text into meaningful groups.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The [`community_detection`](https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/util.html#sentence_transformers.util.community_detection) function in the Sentence Transformers library is a useful utility for finding clusters or communities of semantically similar sentences. Here are the details of the function parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `document_embeddings`: This is the list of embeddings for the documents in your corpus. The embeddings can be created using any of the Sentence Transformer models. The embeddings should be in the form of a 2D tensor or a list of 1D tensors. Each embedding should be a fixed-length vector that represents the semantic meaning of a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `threshold`: This is a float value between 0 and 1 that determines the cutoff for considering two documents to be part of the same community. It's based on the cosine similarity of the document embeddings. If the cosine similarity of two document embeddings is greater than the threshold, those two documents are considered to be in the same community. The higher the threshold, the more similar the documents in each community will be. However, a higher threshold may also result in more communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `min_community_size`: This is the minimum number of documents that a community must have. If a community has fewer than this number of documents, it will be discarded. The default value is 1, but you might want to set a higher value if you're interested in larger communities. This can help filter out noise and find more meaningful communities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- `batch_size`: As the function computes cosine similarities between document pairs, it may consume a significant amount of memory for a large corpus. To manage this, the computations are done in batches. The batch_size parameter determines the number of document pairs to compute similarities for in each batch. Larger batch sizes can be faster but consume more memory, while smaller batch sizes are slower but more memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function returns a list of communities, where each community is a list of indices in the original list of documents. Each community represents a group of semantically similar documents based on the provided threshold."
